# Portfolio Site Build — Assignment Summary

## Executive Overview

Using Claude Code (an AI-powered CLI tool), I successfully built and deployed a complete, production-ready portfolio site for my professional GitHub account in a single session. The site is now live at **https://garrett-ferrara.github.io** and showcases my work in intelligence analysis, OSINT methods, and academic research.

---

## How Claude Code Worked for Me

### Initial Context

The project began with a clear specification provided by ChatGPT in `claude.txt`. The specification detailed:
- Site architecture (6 main pages + 4 portfolio artifacts)
- Design system (dark mode default, gold accent colors, WCAG AA accessibility)
- Technology stack (Jekyll, vanilla JavaScript, CSS design tokens)
- Content model (markdown-based, Git version control)

### The Claude Code Workflow

I used Claude Code as an **agentic coding assistant**, meaning it:
1. **Understood the full specification** from the text file
2. **Planned and executed the build** in phases
3. **Managed file creation and code generation** across 31 files
4. **Handled git version control** with logical commits
5. **Solved problems** (GitHub authentication, branch configuration)
6. **Deployed to production** (GitHub Pages configuration)

### Phase Breakdown

#### Phase 1: Planning & Review (10 minutes)
- Converted `claude.txt` to `claude.md` for better formatting
- Reviewed specification for feasibility
- Identified no blockers — all requirements achievable
- Created comprehensive build plan with 17 tasks

#### Phase 2: Project Initialization (30 minutes)
- Initialized git repository locally
- Created Jekyll configuration (`_config.yml`, `_data/site.yml`)
- Established directory structure with proper organization
- First commit: "Initialize Jekyll site structure with layouts, includes, and design tokens"

#### Phase 3: Layouts & Styling (40 minutes)
- Created 4 layout templates (default, page, artifact, CV)
- Built 6 include partials (head, header, footer, nav, theme-toggle, analytics)
- Generated 850+ lines of production CSS with design tokens
- Implemented dark/light mode toggle with localStorage persistence
- Second commit: "Initialize Jekyll site structure..."

#### Phase 4: Content Creation (45 minutes)
- Created 6 main markdown pages (home, CV, portfolio, texts, repos, contact)
- Built 4 portfolio artifacts with proper front matter
- Included complete copy for Alethea and First Monday (verbatim from spec)
- Scaffolded LLM analysis and assignments with TODOs for my content
- Implemented client-side portfolio filtering with vanilla JavaScript
- Third commit: "Add all content pages and portfolio artifacts"

#### Phase 5: Documentation (30 minutes)
- Created comprehensive README.md (500+ lines)
- Built QUICK_START.md for rapid deployment
- Generated IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md for project overview
- Added deployment guides and troubleshooting
- Fourth commit: "Add comprehensive documentation and build spec"

#### Phase 6: GitHub Deployment (20 minutes)
- Authenticated to GitHub under Garrett-Ferrara account (switched from BigPhysh)
- Created repository: `garrett-ferrara/garrett-ferrara.github.io`
- Pushed all commits to main branch
- Configured GitHub Pages to auto-build from main
- Deleted unnecessary master branch
- Fifth commit: "Add quick start guide for rapid deployment"

#### Phase 7: Verification & Summary (15 minutes)
- Verified GitHub Pages configuration
- Confirmed site is building and deploying
- Created DEPLOYMENT_VERIFIED.md
- Generated final project summary

**Total Time: ~3 hours for complete portfolio site from zero to production**

- Skip-to-content link for keyboard navigation
- Focus-visible styles on all interactive elements
- Semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy
- Per-page meta tags (OG cards, Twitter cards, canonical URLs)

### 4. **Theme System**
- CSS custom properties (variables) for all colors
- Dark mode default with localStorage persistence
- Light mode toggle button (sun/moon SVG icons)
- System preference detection (`prefers-color-scheme`)
- Smooth transitions between themes

### 5. **Portfolio Filtering**
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Client-side tag filtering
- Tags: OSINT, Academic Writing, Agentic Coding, LLM Evaluation, Editorial Leadership
- Filter pills with active state indication
- Works without page reloads

### 6. **Content Organization**
- Jekyll collections for artifacts
- Automatic sorting by weight and date
- 4 portfolio items with metadata (title, summary, role, tags, date)
- Artifact detail pages with automatic URLs
- Back-to-portfolio navigation

### 7. **Professional Features**
- CV with print-to-PDF button (uses `window.print()`)
- Print stylesheet (light background, dark text, no nav)
- Contact form (Formspree integration ready)
- Honeypot field for spam protection
- LinkedIn link in footer
- Global disclaimer for NDA/cleared work
- Favicon and Open Graph image
