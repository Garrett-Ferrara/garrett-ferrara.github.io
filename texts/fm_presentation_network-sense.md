## Understanding Network Sense

**Network sense** is a methodological approach developed by Derek Mueller for making large-scale textual patterns legible and meaningful. Rather than reading deeply into individual texts, network sense asks: *What connections hover just beyond immediate perception? How can we visualize disciplinary constellations to understand where scholars congregate, which problems demand collective attention, and how concepts influence one another across time?*

### Mueller's Core Insight

Mueller writes:

> "[Thin and distant research methods] lay plain layered and connective patterns that, because they can be apprehended, provide a basis for sensing more extensively the connections that hover just beyond the point where one decides to begin."

This framework operates at multiple levels simultaneously:

**Macro Level:** Stacked area charts and heatmaps reveal whether and how frequently key concepts appear across time. Peaks and valleys mark moments of heightened scholarly attention—moments that tell us something about what questions, crises, or theoretical developments animated the field.

**Meso Level:** Individual term trajectories show how each concept's prominence shifted independently. When did "Identity" rise sharply in Internet Studies? When did "Rhetoric" plateau? What external events or disciplinary moves correlate with these shifts?

**Micro Level:** Bubble charts and normalized heatmaps layer multiple dimensions—prevalence, frequency density, temporal distribution—to show how individual terms evolved within their own trajectories, relative to their peaks and valleys.

### What Network Sense Is NOT

Network sense does not replace close reading or interpretive insight. Rather, it provides a *foundation* for sense-making: by revealing where scholars congregate, distant reading invites closer examination of *why* those congregations matter. The rigor of this analysis rests not on its scale but on the human judgment applied to understand what patterns mean.

As scholars move into the age of generative AI and large-scale textual corpora, the premium shifts away from the ability to discover patterns and toward the ability to *interpret* patterns with depth, context, and scholarly nuance.

### Why Network Sense for Internet Studies?

*First Monday*, founded in 1996, stands as one of the earliest peer-reviewed journals dedicated to the Internet as a social, political, and cultural phenomenon. By mapping how core rhetoric and composition concepts have shifted in frequency and prominence across nearly three decades of scholarly conversation, we gain insight into the genealogy of our field's engagement with technology, authority, and meaning-making in networked contexts.

Network sense reveals not just what scholars wrote about, but *when* and with what *relative emphasis*—the temporal patterns that define disciplinary turns.
