## About This Presentation

This interactive hub guides you through how agentic coding tools assisted a distant reading analysis of First Monday (1996-2025), exploring how core rhetoric and composition concepts have evolved alongside emerging internet studies terminology. Each page is self-contained, explore in any order or follow along a more traditional route with the navigation buttons at the bottom of each page.

<div class="disclaimer-box">
  <strong>Generative AI Acknowledgment:</strong>
  <p>The author acknowledges the use of OpenAI's ChatGPT 5 and Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4 / Claude Code 2.0.31 in generating the infrastructure, data scraping tools, visualizations, and isolated text used in this project. AI-generated text appears most prominently in the Methodology section and in various low-stakes titles, labels, or descriptions created when building out the site. No AI-generated insights or conclusions were included unless explicitly cited otherwise, and all final content was written or reviewed by the author. Thorough details of how AI was used in this project is covered in the Methodology and Agentic Coding Applications sections.</p>
</div>

**What you'll find:** Four pages consist of slide-style presentations introducing the project, its methodology, and its key takeaways. Below, five individual pages contain graphs and charts showcasing the projects data in different ways.

**How to navigate:** Click any box above to jump to that section. Use the "← Back to Presentation Hub" button at the bottom of each page to return here.

**About the analysis:** This work applies **network sense** methodology (Derek Mueller) to trace disciplinary turns in Internet Studies. The analysis examines 2,710 articles using n-gram frequency analysis, agentic coding, and interactive visualizations to reveal macro-level patterns in scholarly conversation.

**Time commitment:** 15–20 minutes for full exploration, or 5–10 minutes for selected sections.
