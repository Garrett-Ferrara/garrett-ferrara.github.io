## About This Presentation

This interactive hub guides you through a distant reading analysis of *First Monday* (1996–2025), exploring how core rhetoric and composition concepts have evolved alongside emerging digital studies terminology. Each page is self-contained and independent—explore in any order by clicking the boxes above.

**What you'll find:** Eight sections combining conceptual frameworks (Network Sense, Methodology, Findings), interactive visualizations (four different chart types), and reflections on scholarly method in the age of generative AI.

**How to navigate:** Click any box above to jump to that section. Use the "← Back to Presentation Hub" button at the bottom of each page to return here.

**About the analysis:** This work applies **network sense** methodology (Derek Mueller) to trace disciplinary turns in Internet Studies. The analysis examines 2,710 articles using n-gram frequency analysis, agentic coding, and interactive visualizations to reveal macro-level patterns in scholarly conversation.

**Time commitment:** 15–20 minutes for full exploration, or 5–10 minutes for selected sections.
