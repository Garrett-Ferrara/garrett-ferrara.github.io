## Key Findings: Disciplinary Turns in Internet Studies

### Persistence of Core RhetComp Concepts

The most striking finding is the **sustained presence of foundational rhetoric and composition concepts**—Rhetoric, Writing, and Composition—across nearly three decades of *First Monday* scholarship. These terms remain consistently prominent even as the field grapples with entirely new phenomena. This suggests that Internet Studies has not abandoned traditional rhetorical frameworks but rather *adapted* them.

### The Rise of Identity and Discourse

Beginning in the early 2000s, terms like **Identity** and **Discourse** surge in scholarly attention. This rise correlates with:
- The maturation of social media platforms (MySpace, Facebook, Twitter)
- Increased scholarly focus on digital identity formation and representation
- Growing recognition of how language and communication practices differ online

These concepts represent the discipline's attempt to theorize digital subjectivity and communication through established rhetorical lenses—a clear case of *adaptation rather than replacement*.

### Digital Studies Terminology as Supplementary

Digital-specific concepts (Digital Media, Online Communities, Digital Divide) emerge and gain traction, but they do not displace foundational terms. Instead, they supplement the analytical toolkit, allowing scholars to address phenomena that pre-digital theory could not have anticipated. The field has thus become more conceptually rich rather than fundamentally fractured.

### Implications for Field Positioning

For scholars working in Internet Studies and Rhetoric:

1. **Grounding in tradition:** Your work can draw on classical and contemporary rhetorical theory while addressing emergent digital phenomena
2. **Conceptual hybridity:** Terms like "digital rhetoric" and "online discourse" are not contradictions—they represent legitimate scholarly extensions
3. **Epistemological openness:** The field remains receptive to new terminology while valuing continuity with established frameworks

### Questions Raised by the Data

This analysis also raises important questions for future inquiry:

- **What external events correspond with peaks and valleys?** Do policy changes, technological milestones, or social crises explain shifts in scholarly attention?
- **Citation patterns:** Do scholars citing "Rhetoric" engage with the same theoretical canon as those citing "Digital Media," or has the meaning of foundational terms shifted?
- **Author cohorts:** Do emerging scholars introduce new terminology more readily than established researchers?
- **Comparative study:** How does *First Monday*'s trajectory differ from other digital studies venues? Are these patterns field-wide or journal-specific?

### The Bigger Picture

What these visualizations reveal is a discipline in **productive conversation with itself**: maintaining theoretical continuity while remaining epistemically open to new ideas. Internet Studies is not about replacing Rhetoric and Composition—it's about expanding what those fields can explain and theorize in a networked age.
