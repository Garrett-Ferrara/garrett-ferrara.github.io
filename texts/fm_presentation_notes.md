Assignment Details:

This assignment will give you practice with distant and thin reading of the field (or meadow) of Rhet/Comp, focusing on one of it's subfields or interdisciplinary areas. The purposes are to help you develop a "network sense" of a part of the field that seems promising for your research (including methods for mapping it), and to create a map that will help you and others fairly new to the field better navigate and position yourselves in some part of it. In addition to our class, your audience will be other current and even prospective MA and graduate students.

Using elements of the theoretical framework, methodology, and tools discussed in Mueller’s Network Sense, you’ll create a digital, networked map--or, in most cases, set of related maps of one of the field’s widely recognized subfields or (interdisciplinary) areas, possibly focused on how it intersects with another subfield or area. An extension of the forum analysis, this assignment should give you a more focused network sense of a scholarly area you wish to situate your work and participate in. Your map(s) should provide both a synchronic and diachronic sense (e.g., how has the area/program shifted over time), though I will help you define the scope of both and determine what textual (or other) data you can use to do so.

Possible map forms include (but are not limited to) word clouds, radial model, citation frequency graphs, maps of scholarly lineage or career paths, maps show geolocations of scholars or programs in a region or conference sites over time, and other maps of scholarly activity. The methods for developing your maps must employ distant and thin reading, and involve both computer-generated and interpretive analysis, the former through free Web-based resources that we will identify together. Your map(s) can focus on any number of connections that can elucidate the area. Multiple maps can show patterns across a forum, or they could compare scholarly activity across forums or locations. Your map(s) should also situate your interests and (planned) contributions to the area in some way. Finally, you’ll use your exploration and mapping in this unit to refine (and perhaps also expand) your scholarly interests, and to learn and practice additional strategies for collaborative learning in a community of practice.

Assignment Parameters

Gain network sense about scholarly activity in Rhet/Comp subfield or area related to one of your scholarly interests, broadly defined (can be a new interest for you)
Focus on patterns in scholarly activity over time; can also compare patterns across forums (in most cases will have multiple points of comparison)
Include (adjusted) visualizations and written (minimum 750 words) explanation of your process and interpretation of visualizations and the larger network sense they enable (see below)
Steps of Process (will likely be somewhat iterative; document your steps along the way)

Identify subfield or area and, if you prefer, any related topical interest (broadly defined) that you know (perhaps from forum analysis) has been taken up in subfield
Determine questions about patterns of scholarly activity over time, including timeframe and segments
Decide on forums from which to create data sets
Decide what info in forums you will mine to create data sets
Create data sets around key points of comparison (could start with Google docs)
Decide starting types of visualizations and consider ones that you could create next
Create and adapt visualizations
Interpret visualizations from your perspective (this can involve raising follow-up questions)
Final Product

Your maps can be shared through any number of means, including a small web text that links to them, a slideshow, an infographic, or a digital poster. They should be accompanied by written explanation/interpretation of at least 750 words (but substantially shorter than the article-length examples in Unit 3 Readings/Resources) that covers the following:

Your questions and why you’re asking them
A brief explanation of network sense and how it is helpful to answer your questions (can cite Mueller here)
The steps (including rationale) of your process, including but not limited to:
Determining and revising guiding questions, including points of comparison
Determining forums and other sources of data
Building data sets (and possibly) sub data sets (including identifying codes, categories)
Adjusting maps (e.g., clustering or eliminating terms; experimenting with sizes; discarding or replacing parts of maps)
Your visualizations and interpretation of them, including what they suggest for you (and others with similar questions) about developing your work and positioning it in the field, about remaining or new questions they raise for you, about other kinds of maps they could lead to

Peer Review Questions (what I'll be graded on)

1. How well does the introductory section of the written explanation (along with the title)
indicate the exigency, focus, and guiding questions of the mapping? Where could this be
clearer? Where and how could the author further preview what’s to come?
2. How well does the introductory section of the written explanation connect the mapping
to network sense, explaining the author’s take on this concept/method and citing Muller
(and possibly others) where appropriate? How could this connection be strengthened
and explained for an audience of beginning grad students?
3. How well does the written explanation (in framing section and/or embedded
throughout) explain the mapping process (from developing questions onward) and its
steps and possible pivots, including your rationale for these? Point out places where the
explanation seems too vague or is missing a rationale. Where could the writer link to
their data sets?
4. How well do the visualizations provide a network sense that aligns with the mapping
questions? How well do the visualizations work together, and what points of
comparison do they illuminate? Make any suggestions about points of comparison and
about adjusting, adding to, or using a different combination of visualizations.
5. Where and how could any of the visualizations be fine-tuned in their presentation to
better focus on the author’s mapping questions and otherwise help readers recognize a
network sense? Consider focus, size, titles/captions, etc.
6. How well does the written explanation interpret the visualizations and network sense
that they provide, including around any points of comparison? Where could the author
further discuss what the visualizations suggest to them, including any patterns and gaps
they show (individually and collectively) and the author’s reactions to these (e.g.,
surprises, confusion, disappointment, excitement)?
7. How well does the written explanation discuss any implications of the network sense
provided by the mapping, including around continued or new questions, opportunities/
challenges for situating the author’s work in the field, and follow-up inquiries?
8. How easy to follow and logical is the organization? Where could the author use or
improve headings/subheadings and transitions? Where and how could the formatting
and design better help readers follow the argument? How would the visualizations and
written explanation be better aligned in their placement?
9. Where could the author’s perspective, values, and voice be further integrated into the
written explanation?
