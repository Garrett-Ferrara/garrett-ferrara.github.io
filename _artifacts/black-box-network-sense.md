## Overview

"Black Box Network Sense" is an interactive research presentation that combines disciplinary analysis with agentic coding methodology. The project explores how core rhetoric and composition concepts have evolved within *First Monday* (1996–2025), a leading peer-reviewed journal in Internet Studies.

## Key Components

**Network Sense Framework**
Mueller's methodology for understanding disciplinary patterns through distant reading—examining macro-level trends in scholarly conversation across hundreds of articles.

**Agentic Coding**
Working iteratively with Claude Code, I developed a scalable approach to research-grade corpus construction, data validation, and interactive visualization. This demonstrates effective human-AI collaboration in academic research.

**Interactive Visualizations**
The presentation features five different chart types exploring n-gram frequency analysis:
- **Stacked Area**: Combined frequency trends across all key terms
- **Term Trajectories**: Individual term evolution with trendlines
- **Bubble Charts**: Multidimensional analysis of term relationships
- **Temporal Heatmaps**: Toggle between unigrams and bigrams for granular term prevalence
- **Normalized to Peak**: Comparative view of term prevalence as percentage of peak maximum

## Methodology

- **Corpus**: 2,710 articles across 359 issues (1996–2025)
- **Data Quality**: Dual parsing strategies, ISO 8601 date normalization, validation reports
- **Ethics**: Throttled requests, robots.txt respect, idempotent checkpoints
- **Tools**: Python web scraping, data processing, interactive visualization framework

## Scholarly Impact

This work demonstrates how distant reading combined with agentic coding can reveal disciplinary turns in Internet Studies. The resulting visualizations support citation analysis, author-network mapping, and macro-level pattern recognition across foundational digital-studies literature.
