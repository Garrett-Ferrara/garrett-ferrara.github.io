## Context

As Managing Editor of Alethea's Analysis Team, I edited nearly 10,000 pages of intelligence reporting. While most work remains confidential, this public case study illustrates how raw data and disparate observations were transformed into coherent strategic intelligence. My role included synthesizing technical findings (e.g., network analysis), establishing key intelligence questions, and shaping narratives for policymakers, journalists, and security professionals. Final visual layouts were compiled by contracted designers.

## The Case Study

This analysis uncovered a sophisticated Russian military intelligence (GRU) network of 5,314 X accounts using novel evasion tactics to amplify Doppelgänger content, revealing a strategic shift from broad division to targeting Western support for Ukraine through conservative-leaning narratives.
