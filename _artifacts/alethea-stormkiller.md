## Context

As Managing Editor of Alethea's Analysis Team, I edited nearly 10,000 pages of intelligence reporting. While most work remains confidential, this public case study illustrates how raw data and disparate observations were transformed into coherent strategic intelligence. My role included synthesizing technical findings (e.g., network analysis), establishing key intelligence questions, and shaping narratives for policymakers, journalists, and security professionals. Final visual layouts were compiled by contracted designers.

## The Case Study

This analysis exposed Russian influence networks' shift to deflecting blame for their own operations after DOJ indictments, including fabricated statements from disinformation experts claiming Ukraine was responsible for Russian influence campaigns targeting the 2024 election.
