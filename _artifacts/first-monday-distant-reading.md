This graduate digital text project applies distant reading methodology and agentic coding to trace disciplinary turns in Internet Studies scholarship. By analyzing 2,710 articles from *First Monday* (1996–2025) using n-gram frequency analysis, the project reveals how core rhetoric and composition concepts (Identity, Discourse, Writing, Rhetoric, Composition) have persisted and evolved alongside emerging digital studies terminology.

**Key Achievements:**
- Built a research-grade corpus with 100% extraction success through iterative AI collaboration
- Implemented dual validation strategies ensuring data integrity and transparent provenance
- Created interactive visualizations (heatmaps, line graphs, carousel navigation) revealing temporal patterns in disciplinary language
- Demonstrated how agentic coding accelerates infrastructure scaffolding while preserving human authorship over research design and interpretation

**Technical Scope:**
Web scraping infrastructure, metadata extraction and normalization, n-gram frequency analysis, responsive visualization design with Jekyll integration, and rigorous quality assurance protocols.

**Disciplinary Significance:**
The analysis illustrates how internet studies has adapted rather than replaced traditional RhetComp frameworks, revealing a field learning to theorize digital phenomena through established rhetorical lenses while remaining epistemically open to new conceptual formations.
