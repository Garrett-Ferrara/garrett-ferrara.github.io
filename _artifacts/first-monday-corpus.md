## Technical Development Through AI Collaboration

Working iteratively with Claude Code in VS, I directed a web scraping system that extracted 2,710 articles from 359 issues (1996–2025). Challenges included platform migrations (legacy HTML → OJS), changing metadata schemas, and ethical crawling with robust error handling and checkpointing.

## Research Design and Quality Assurance

I established the research framework, validation protocols, and QA standards—dual parsing strategies (legacy + modern), ISO 8601 date normalization, and documentation/validation reports—to ensure research-grade data quality.

## Academic Impact and Methodology

The resulting corpus supports thin/distant analysis of internet research trends, author-network mapping, and citation analysis across foundational digital-studies literature—demonstrating effective human-AI collaboration.
