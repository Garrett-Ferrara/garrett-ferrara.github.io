## Context

As Managing Editor of Alethea's Analysis Team, I edited nearly 10,000 pages of intelligence reporting. While most work remains confidential, the public case studies below illustrate how raw data and disparate observations were transformed into coherent strategic intelligence. My role included synthesizing technical findings (e.g., network analysis), establishing key intelligence questions, and shaping narratives for policymakers, journalists, and security professionals. Final visual layouts were compiled by contracted designers.

## Silicon Valley Bank Crisis Analysis

Tracked disinformation narratives during the March 2023 bank collapse, identifying how venture capitalist communications, foreign state media, and "go woke, go broke" rhetoric amplified financial panic and contributed to the crisis.

## Spamou-Gabbing: Chinese Influence Operation

Documented the first confirmed expansion of China's Spamouflage Dragon campaign to American alternative social platforms, revealing coordinated efforts to target right-wing audiences on Gab while spreading pro-CCP messaging about Xinjiang, dissidents, and rare earth mining.

## Stormkiller: Russian IO Coverup

Exposed Russian influence networks' shift to deflecting blame for their own operations after DOJ indictments, including fabricated statements from disinformation experts claiming Ukraine was responsible for Russian influence campaigns targeting the 2024 election.

## Writing with Invisible Ink

Uncovered a sophisticated Russian military intelligence (GRU) network of 5,314 X accounts using novel evasion tactics to amplify DoppelgÃ¤nger content, revealing a strategic shift from broad division to targeting Western support for Ukraine through conservative-leaning narratives.
