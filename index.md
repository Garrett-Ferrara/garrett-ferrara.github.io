## About This Work

I'm an analyst and editor who works at the intersection of intelligence tradecraft, writing theory, and knowledge management. My practice involves identifying signals in complex information environments and synthesizing them into coherent, actionable narratives for diverse audiencesâ€”policymakers, journalists, security professionals, and researchers.

Most of my professional work has been completed under security clearances or non-disclosure agreements. The materials featured here represent publicly shareable selections from my career, including published research, academic work, and case studies that illustrate my approach to evidence synthesis, editorial rigor, and strategic communication.

## Areas of Focus

**Intelligence & Influence Operations**
Analysis of disinformation campaigns, narrative warfare, and information security. Experience with platform-native influence operations research and geopolitical narrative analysis.

**OSINT & Research Methods**
Open-source intelligence collection, corpus building, and knowledge infrastructure. Expertise in scaling qualitative research through agentic coding and human-AI collaboration.

**Writing & Editorial Leadership**
Developmental editing, narrative architecture, and audience-centric communication. Background in rhetorical theory, composition pedagogy, and knowledge management systems.
